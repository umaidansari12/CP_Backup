/*
Amazon website contains one to many items in each pagee. To mimic the logic of the websire, an Amazon programmer has a list of items and each item has its name, relevance and price. After sorting the items by [name:0, relevance:1, price:2], the programmer is trying to find out a list of items displayed in a chosen page.

Given a list of items, the sort column, the sortd order(0: ascending, 1:descending), the number of utems to be displayed in each page and a page number, write an algorithm to determine the list of item names in the specified page while respecting the item's order. Page Number starts from 0.
Sample Input:
numOfItems = 3
items: ["item1",10,15],["item2",3,4],["item3",17,8]
sortParameter: 1
sortOrder: 0
itemsPerPage: 2
pageNumber: 1
Output:
{"item3"}
